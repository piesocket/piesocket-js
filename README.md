# PieSocket JavaScript Client

A JavaScript Library for PieSocket Channels.

[PieSocket Channels](https://www.piesocket.com/blog/channels/) are a medium for clients and servers to communicate in real-time. Client-to-client communications are also supported.

Note: This package is for client-side subscribing, if you are looking for the package to use on the server-side for publishing, please see [PieSocket-NodeJS](https://github.com/piesocket/piesocket-nodejs).
## Installation

Yarn
```
yarn add piesocket-js
```

NPM
```
npm i piesocket-js
```

CDN
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/piesocket-js@1"></script>
```

## Importing

Import module:

```javascript
import PieSocket from 'piesocket-js';
```

With CDN/Browser:


Use the `PieSocket` global variable

## Subscribe on frontend 

1. Initialize the PieSocket class:
```javascript
var piesocket = new PieSocket({
    clusterId: 'YOUR_CLUSTER_ID',
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY'
});
```

Reference: [Complete list of configuration options](https://github.com/piesocket/piesocket-js#configuration)


2. Subscribe to a channel:
```javascript
var channel = piesocket.subscribe(channelId); 

channel.on("open", ()=>{
  console.log("PieSocket Channel Connected!");
});
```


3. Listen to message event:
```javascript
channel.on('message', function(event){
    console.log(event.data);
});
```
Use `JSON.parse` on `event.data` if it is json.

Following are other supported events:
  - `open`
  - `message`
  - `error`
  - `close`

## Publish from browser

You can enable `C2C` (Client to client) communication for your API key from your PieSocket account to use the `send` method of the Channel object to send messages directly from a client.
```javascript
channel.send(stringText);
```

To send JSON, use following code:
```javascript
channel.send(JSON.stringify(payload));
```

Make sure you are calling `send` method after connection has been made i.e `on('open', callback)` has been called.

## Publish from server
Use the following POST request to publish a message from your server.

```
POST /api/publish HTTP/1.1
Host: CLUSTER_ID.piesocket.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "key": "API_KEY",
    "secret": "API_SECRET",
    "channelId": "CHANNEL_ID",
    "message": "Hello world!"
}
```
See code examples for this request in PHP, NodeJS, Ruby, Python, Java and Go in our [official documentation](https://www.piesocket.com/docs/3.0/overview).

## Blockchain Realtime
Send 100% trustworthy messages to connected peers and maintain a proof of the message on the Ethereum Blockchain network. 

To send a message on the Blockhain
```javascript
channel.sendOnBlockchain(payload);
```
`payload` should be a string. 
You will have to sign this message using the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download) Ethereum Wallet.

To confirm a message on the receiver's end.
```javascript
channel.confimOnBlockchain(transactionHash);
```
`transactionHash` is the transaction hash received from the blockchain message sender.

To get a list of blockchain messages pending acceptance, use the [REST API](https://www.piesocket.com/docs/3.0/rest-api).
